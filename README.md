# Heart Disease Prediction System ðŸ«€

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient attributes.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key health indicators.
- Built and evaluated ML models (Logistic Regression).
- Achieved ~85% accuracy on training and 80% accuracy on the testing dataset.

##**Outcome**
- Having 0 predict the person does not have Heart Disease
